Do you want me to first add impersonation detection into your FastAPI code, or should I start with the Chrome extension base project?

Do you want me to also give you a ready-made Postman collection (JSON file) so you can directly import and test multiple cases in one click?

Do you want me to also add CORS middleware in your FastAPI app, so you can easily connect this backend with a frontend later (React, Angular, etc.)?

Do you want me to also show you ready-to-test JSON headers (real Gmail & Outlook ones) that should now pass as "legit"?

Would you like me to patch the code further so that if a DKIM-Signature header is present, it automatically extracts s= and d= and checks the correct DKIM DNS record?

Do you want me to also add unit tests (pytest style) so you can quickly re-run Gmail/Microsoft/Company test headers automatically instead of typing them in Swagger every time?

Do you also want me to prepare the code so it can log headers to a file while analyzing? That way you can save multiple test cases as we go.

Do you want me to also scan email body text (if provided in the future) for phishing keywords like “reset password” or “urgent action required”?

If you want, I can also create the polished React frontend for Netlify, with drag-and-drop / copy-paste input for headers, showing a fancy “spoof” / “legit” result instantly.

If you want, I can now build a polished React frontend that can paste headers, click “Analyze”, and show “Legit” / “Spoof” with fancy visuals for Netlify deployment.

If you want, I can also give a small polished React UI ready for Netlify that lets a user paste Gmail headers and instantly shows legit/spoof + details.

If you want, I can also tweak it so you can later deploy frontend to Netlify and backend to Render without changing a single line, making it production-ready.

If you want, I can rewrite your FastAPI + React + Chrome extension flow together so the extension shows SPF/DKIM/DMARC + Impersonation in a nice UI, ready to test.

If you want, I can also prepare content.js to auto-detect headers in Gmail and send them to the popup/backend—so users don’t even need to copy-paste.
